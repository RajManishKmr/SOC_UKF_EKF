# Project: State of Charge Estimation based on Unscented Kalman Filter
1. Estimated the State of Charge (SoC) of a Li-ion Battery using a 2nd Order R-RC Equivalent Circuit Model, while
accounting for the impact of key physical battery parameters.
2. The project encompasses MATLAB code, simulations, and a comparison with EKF-based SoC estimation, demon-
strating the effectiveness of the UKF-based SoC estimation algorithm
# Features
## Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF): 
Implemented the UKF algorithm within Simulink to predict the battery's SoC, accounting for nonlinearities and varying operating conditions
## MATLAB Implementation: 
The project includes the MATLAB Simulink Model that implements the UKF-based SoC estimation algorithm.
